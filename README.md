Finding who isn't following you on Instagram has never been easier.<br>
Say goodbye to navigating phishy websites or sharing your login details with third-party apps.<br>

✔️ Then, this open source website compares those two lists to identify those who aren't following you back. It generates links to the profiles of these accounts, allowing you to manually unfollow them.<br>
<br>
🔒 No third-party apps or unconventional process. Everything follows a straightforward process with a user-friendly design.
